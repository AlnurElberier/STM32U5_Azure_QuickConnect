serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'

    Open Terminal and type:

    ls -l /dev/ttyACM*

    you will get something like:

    crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 5 apr 23.01 ttyACM0

    The "0" at the end of ACM might be a different number, or multiple entries might be returned. The data we need is "dialout" (is the group owner of the file).

    Now we just need to add our user to the group:

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

    then:

    sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

    You will need to log out and log in again for this change to take effect.
